                                I am 29 years old and currently live in Frederiksberg, after having lived in Tokyo twice,
                                where I studied Japanese and worked part-time.
                                I completed the second part of the foundational course in Data and Communications on January 10, 2025,
                                and I am now ready to begin my first apprenticeship in my dream fieldâ€”software development.
                                I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting and continue growing as a programmer.

                        <p>
                            <strong>A simple chat app with a server side and a client side using tcp sockets.</strong>
                            (now working on making a simple gui for the client side)
                            This has helped me learn and become better at sockets programming. As well as handling multiple connections using multi-threading
                            In the future I would like to add message history (saving chat logs), adding users and authentication and maybe file sharing.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>A C program to calculate days between two dates.</strong>
                            While developing the program, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use pointers and their practical use.
                            This was a good learning experience since i had mostly worked with languages that don't involve pointers before.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>A still in work in progress java2D game without the use of a game engine.</strong>
                            This has helped me learn how to draw to and update a canvas.
                            This has helped me understand how you could implement delta time functions
                            to ensure the game runs smoothly and updates the desired number of times in a second.
